## Introduction

The DApp is hosted on client-inky-beta.vercel.app




With Gullak, you simply lock up your ERC20 for a predefined period of time, in exchange of some extra incentive either donated by the project, or the penalties collected from quitters. 

There're lots of paramters to customized, for more detail about how the contract works, visit our [contract repo](https://github.com/hodlmybeer/hodl).


## Run 

```
npm  i
```

Copy `.evn.example` as `.env` and add the env variables


```
npm start
```
